# Deployment Tracker

The Deployment Tracker tracks deployments of sample applications to [IBM Bluemix](https://www.bluemix.net/).

## Cloning

Get the project and change into the project directory:

    $ git clone https://github.com/cloudant-labs/deployment-tracker.git
    $ cd deployment-tracker

## Configuring Local Development

Local configuration is done through a `.env` file. One environment variable, `VCAP_SERVICES`, is needed in order to configure your local development environment. The value of the `VCAP_SERVICES` is a string representation of a JSON object. Here is an example `.env` file:

    VCAP_SERVICES={"cloudantNoSQLDB": [{"name": "deployment-tracker-db","label": "cloudantNoSQLDB","plan": "Shared","credentials": {"username": "your-username","password": "your-password","host": "your-host","port": 443,"url": "https://your-username:your-password@your-host"}}]}

**Note:**  Services created within Bluemix are automatically added to the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable. Therefore, no configuration is needed for Bluemix.
